						<p class="diary_para2">I didn't know anything about how to create a website so i googled the following sentence'create a website with html and css' and found  
							<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2UnYs9AA_M&t=775s">HTML tutorial</a> that helped me a lot to begin with. 
							I started off by coding the home page with navigation buttons at the top of window that in the future you will be able to click and go to another page for example the diary page.

                        <p class="diary_para3">After creating the home page and the navigation buttons i started to make the other pages that would be on the website, the diary, assignment, group members and about me pages. Uploaded images of group members to the group members page and uploaded my resume to the site.

						<p class="diary_para3">By Tuesday the 21st of January i had made a website that had a home page, diary page and group member page. But after hearing that you could go use a template to create your website to make it much easier for you, I decided to start from scratch but this time around use a html template.
                        I found the website	<a href="https://html5up.net">HTML5</a>, were there are many templates to choose from. The template that i chose is called Telephasic. 
                        <div><img src="images/Telephasic.png" width ="1000" height="350" alt ="avatar3" class="avatar3"></div>
                        All I had to do was click on the download link and the template was saved on my computer. From then on it was easy to create my website. I copy all the work i had already done and put it into my new website and uploaded my resume to the website.

                        <h1>Workload-1.5 Hours</h1>

                </section>
                <section class ="git"> 
					<div class ="git">
						<h2 class="git">Github</h2>
						<p class="diary_para3">The final part of the assignment was to upload my website to github. I had already done something similar in the course Software Developement so i new how to connect my folder to github. 
                            To start with i had to create a repository on github and copy the clone URL of the repository. Step 2 was to open the terminal on my computer and change the working directory to my local folder where my website it saved.
                            Step 3 was to type the command "git clone https://github.com/OlafurMelville/olafurmelville.github.io.git" and press enter. Step 4 was to add the local folder to the repository by typing the command "git ."" 
                            Step 5 was to commit the folder by typing the command "git commit -m 'First commit'" into the terminal. And finally pushing the folder by typing the command "git push origin master".
