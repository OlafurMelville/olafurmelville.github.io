                    <p class="diary_para">For our final project of the course Manufacturing Processes, a group of three people had to make something big with the CNC, mold an object and cast then cast it and finally design and fabricate a model (30cm2) and produce a fiber composite of it.

                    <p class="part2_para"> We had a team meating in the beginning of March to decide what we wanted to create. We came up with the idea of designing a epoxy resin table like the one below
                        <div><img src="images/epoxy.jpg" width ="400" height="500" alt ="avatar3" class="avatar3"></div>
                        It would be designed to imitate the waterfall Hjálparfoss in Þjórsárdalur.
                        A detailed description of the process designing and creating the table can be read on the groups website <a href="https://assignment-7.github.io/final/"> Final Project - Exopy table </a>
                        I will be documenting the work done by myself in the final project below.
                        
                        
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class ="part3">
                <div class ="part3_col3">
                    <h3 class="Part 3">Project</h3>
                    <p class="part3_para"> The Covid-19 pandemic affected the project early on. Everything in Iceland closed for 2 months so we knew early on that we would not be able to manufacture the table. Instead we were meant to do a simulation of the project and document just like we would do if we were able to create the table.    
                        The first step was to divide the work to each group member. I was in charge of documenting everything and uploading it to the <a href="https://assignment-7.github.io/final/"> Group website </a>, monitor the project management progression and create the video documenting the projects progression.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="part4_para">At the beginning of march I listed up the necessary milestones needing to be completed so the project could run smoothly.
                    <div><img src="images/mynd1.png" width ="500" height="300" alt ="avatar3" class="avatar3"></div>
                    <div><img src="images/gant.png" width ="600" height="270" alt ="avatar3" class="avatar3"></div>
                    The simulation went as smoothly as it could, i was able to document the process as each necessary step was taken to simulate the manufacturing of the table. When the table was ready in the beginning of april i created a 3 minute video that shows the process of creating the epoxy table. 
                    In the end i worked and estimate of 30 hours on our final project. We are hoping to manufacture the table over the summer when Fablab opens up again. The end product in the software Inventor can be seen below </p>
