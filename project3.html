                    <p class="diary_para">Our third assignment in the course Manufacturing processes was split into two assignments. The first was to use a design software to make something that could not be made subtractiveley and then 3D print your design. The second part of the project was to 3D scan something with 3D photogrammetry

                    <p class="part2_para"> I decided to use the design software Solidworks to design a coupling for a prosthetic knee. The coupling can not be made with a laser cutting device because of its round and deep edges. It is a very small object used to keep the prosthetic knee intact.
                        Unfortunately i was using solidworks on the computers at school and didn't take any pictures while i was designing the coupling in solidworks. Now while i am writing this, i am not able to go to school and take pictures of the coupling because the school has been closed because of the covid-19 pandemic. Instead i will try and describe what i did in words with the help of some autocad drawings.
                        I had access to autocad drawings of the part that helped me design the coupling.
                        <div><img src="images/Autocad.jpg" width ="500" height="300" alt ="avatar4" class="avatar4"></div>
                        I began by sketching a rectangle and revolving it 360 degrees. Then with the help of the chamfer tool in solidworks, 
                        cut out the edges to create the coupling. Finally i used the extruded cut tool to create the hole in the middle of the coupling. The final design looked like the picture below.

                <div class ="part3_col3">
                    <h3 class="Part 3">Part 2 - Fablab</h3>
                    <p class="part3_para"> After creating the coupling in Solidworks it was time to visit Fablab-Reykjav√≠k to 3D print the coupling. 
                        Before i could 3D print the coupling i first had to export the file into a slt file and import the file into Ultimaker Cura. Ultimaker Cura is an open source 3D printer slicing application, Ultimaker Cura works by slicing the user's model file into layers and generating a printer-specific g-code. Once finished, the g-code can be sent to the file printer for the manufacture of the physical object. 
                        <div><img src="images/cura.jpg" width ="200" height="200" alt ="avatar3" class="avatar3"></div>
                        I imported the file to Ultimaker Cura, i did not need to make any major changes to the settings in Ultimaker Cura. I changed some settings so the printing would be faster. In the end the coupling would weigh one gramm and the printing would take an estimate of 18 minutes.
                        <div><img src="images/printer.jpg" width ="500" height="500" alt ="avatar3" class="avatar3"></div>
                        <div><img src="images/3D.jpg" width ="500" height="500" alt ="avatar3" class="avatar3"></div>
                        The 3D printing was a success, the picture below is of the coupling that was 3D printed.

                        After some discussion in class, somebody said that the software Regard3D was an easy to use software for this sort of assignment, so i downloaded Regard3D. 
                        I then googled the key word "Regard3D tutorial" and found a video that helped me with this assignment <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOjy6oPnLDA">Regard 3D tutorial</a>. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="para2">
                        I now needed to decide what i wanted to 3D scann. I decided to keep it simple and take a picture of a mug to 3D scan. I finally took  53 pictures of the mug and uploaded them onto my computer and into a folder called 3D scannig.

                        After some discussion in class, somebody said that the software Regard3D was an easy to use software for this sort of assignment, so i downloaded Regard3D. 
                        I then googled the key word "Regard3D tutorial" and found a video that helped me with this assignment <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOjy6oPnLDA">Regard 3D tutorial</a>, it was now time to start using the software.
                    </p>
                    <p class="regard">
                        After opening Regard 3D a window opens up. 
                        <div><img src="images/regard.png" width ="400" height="350" alt ="avatar3" class="avatar3"></div>
                        In the left hand corner there is a button to create a new project, I created a new project called "3D scan" and then imported the pictures into regard by clicking the add picture set button in the left bottom corner. 
                        <div><img src="images/AddFile.png" width ="300" height="400" alt ="avatar3" class="avatar3"></div>
                        Then i pressed the compute matches button and adjust the settings, the tutorial i watched said to move the sliders to the right but leave other settings as they were. 
                        <div><img src="images/ComputeMatches.png" width ="700" height="350" alt ="avatar3" class="avatar3"></div>
                        The next step was to triangulate the matches. Start off by selecting the matches and then press the triangulation button, another window pops up that shows the triangulation settings. You dont need to change any settings just press ok.
                        <div><img src="images/Triangle.png" width ="700" height="350" alt ="avatar3" class="avatar3"></div>
                        The pount cloud that the triangulation produced was ok. To make the model even clearer and denser. Select the triangulation and create a dense pointcloud, i used the same settings the tutorial used.
                        <div><img src="images/Dense.png" width ="700" height="350" alt ="avatar3" class="avatar3"></div>
                        The dense pointcloud produced a better image of the mug. The last step was to create a surface and connect the points in the point cloud together. The tutorial said to stick with the same settings that pop up when you click on "Create Surface" so that is what i did.
                        After doing all the steps the tutorial told me to do, the final 3D model came out ok.
                        <div><img src="images/Final.png" width ="400" height="350" alt ="avatar3" class="avatar3"></div>
                        I then messed around with the polygon mode settings to change the line fill. The next picture shows different polygon mode settings.
                        <div><img src="images/FinalPhotos.png" width ="700" height="700" alt ="avatar3" class="avatar3"></div>
