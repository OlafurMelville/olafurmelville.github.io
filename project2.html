                    <h2> Assignment 2 - Computer-aided design and cutting</h2>
                    
                    <p class="diary_para">Our second assignment in the course Manufacturing processes was to use a CAD software to build a parametric design of a pressfit construction kit. Followed by cutting our design with a laser cutter.
                        The first step of the assignment was to download Autodesk Fusion 360. After a little searching on the internet i decided to keep it simple and design a box that i could keep my car keys in, at home. 
                        I used the video  
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U2JPfkQpsE"> Pressfit Tutorial </a> to help me with the pressfit design
                    </p>
                    
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class ="part2">
                <div class ="part2_col2">
                    <h3 class="Part 2">Part 1 - Fusion 360</h3>
                    <p class="part2_para"> It was now time to design the box. The first step was to create the parameters used for the box,
                        the following photo shows the parameters used for the design
                        <div><img src="images/parametrar.png" width ="500" height="200" alt ="avatar3" class="avatar3"></div>
                        The next step was to draw the first sketch in Fusion. Start off by choosing a plane to draw the sketch on and then start drawing. 
                        The first sketch was a rectangle with the length of the parameter "lengd" and a width of the parameter "Width". I then extruded the sketch a length of the parameter "thickness" to make it into the bottom panel.
                        The next step was to create the fingers on the side of the panel so i could fit all the panels together.
                        The fingers on the sides of the panel where a distance of "lfinger" away from each other with a length of "lfingerw". 
                        The following picture is of the bottom panel.
                        <div><img src="images/kassi1.png" width ="500" height="200" alt ="avatar3" class="avatar3"></div>
                        Doing the same for the front, back, left and right panels the box ended up looking like the following photo, the length of the box was 150mm, the width 75mm and height 30mm
                        <div><img src="images/kassitilbuinn.png" width ="500" height="200" alt ="avatar3" class="avatar3"></div>
                        
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class ="part3">
                <div class ="part3_col3">
                    <h3 class="Part 3">Part 3 - Fablab</h3>
                    <p class="part3_para"> After making the box in Fusion 360 it was time to visit Fablab-Reykjav√≠k to cut my design out with a laser cutter. 
                        Before i could laser cut the design i first had to flatten my design out in fusion so it could be laser cut. 
                        <div><img src="images/flattening.jpg" width ="300" height="350" alt ="avatar3" class="avatar3"></div>
                        Next i had to export my design to a DXF file and then fix the DXF file in a software called <a href="https://inkscape.org"> Inkscape </a>
                        Unfortunately i didn't take any photos when working in inkscape but if i had to give a quick description on what i used inkscape for was to put the final touch on my design so it would be ready to be laser cut. 
                        The last part of the project was to laser cut the design. I first needed to adjust the settings on the laser cutting machine. I used the machine called Luke and the material i used was wood (timbur) so the settings had to be 11/100/500 as seen on the next photo.
                        <div><img src="images/information.jpg" width ="300" height="350" alt ="avatar3" class="avatar3"></div>
                        Then it was time to start laser cutting. <div><img src="images/lasercut.jpg" width ="300" height="350" alt ="avatar3" class="avatar3"></div>
                        Everything went smoothly and i ended up with a pressfit box
